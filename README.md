## Description
The **Machine Learning** part of the MentalQ app helps analyze users' mental health by studying their daily notes. It uses a **LSTM model** to look at the text and understand how users are feeling. The process starts by collecting and cleaning the data, then training the model to recognize different mental health patterns. Once the model is ready, itâ€™s built into the app to give users personalized feedback based on their mood. Tools like **TensorFlow** and **NLTK** help build and improve the model. By using this technology, MentalQ can help users better understand their mental health, offering support when they need it most.

## Installation and Usage of Flask Application

This application uses Flask as a web framework to create an image prediction API using a TensorFlow model. Several dependencies must be installed before running the application.

## Requirement
Make sure you have installed:

Python 3.9 or newer
pip (package installer for Python)

## Installation Steps

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the repository from GitHub to your computer.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MentalQ-App/MentalQ-Model.git
cd model_save_ml/ml_model_lstm.h5
```

2. Ensure Model and Data Availability
Make sure the model file (model.h5) is available in the project's root directory.

3. Run the Application
Run the Flask application using the following command:

```bash
python local.py
```

Open your browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8080 to check the API.

## API Endpoints

Predict
This endpoint is used to upload an image and get a prediction.

URL: /predict
Method: POST
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
Form Data:
image: File gambar (jpg, jpeg, png)

## Usage

Use the /predict endpoint to make predictions based on the input image.

```
curl -X POST -F "image=@path/to/your/image.jpg" http://127.0.0.1:8080/predict
```

Replace path/to/your/image.jpg with the path to the image file you want to predict.

## Example Response

```
{

}
```
